Shockolate - Portable System Shock
============

1. Copy `res/` folder of original System Shock to this directory
2. Install SDL2, SDL2_mixer and Fluidsynth by running `./install_<bits>bit_sdl.sh` where `<bits>` is 32 or 64, depending on your system capabilities. Linux needs `sudo` for this script.
